            VR House Interior
        </h1>
        <p>
            Back in 2018 I spent some time experimenting with the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Go">Oculus Go VR headset</a>. I noticed that
            stereoscopic photographs (where each eye sees a slightly different image) often looked
            blurry and unconvincing. The best looking images that I could find were computer rendered,
            where the stereo alignment was exactly controlled.
        </p>

            I embarked on a project to create the interior of my own new-build house in VR. As it turned
            out, the VR version ended up being completed before the real-life house. I believe that the
            results are some of the best VR images that I had seen at the time.

            I built all of the 3D geometry myself, paying close attention to the accuracy
            of the dimensions, shapes and materials of the objects in the scenes. Each 4K resolution
            stereoscopic image took around eight hours to render on an Nvidia 1070 Ti GPU. I used ray tracing,
            physically-based materials and lighting. Everything was created using
            <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.

            The images below can be viewed on any Meta Quest VR headset. Just visit this page in the
            Quest browser and click on an image.
