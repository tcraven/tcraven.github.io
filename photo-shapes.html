            1. Motivation
        </h2>
        <p>
            During my career break in 2024, I wanted to focus on my personal projects. I love model
            railways, and decided to build a layout in my basement. I want to recreate
            a real-life railway station location as accurately as possible in model form, but the
            only information I have is a collection of old photographs. I want to create models of
            the station buildings with correct dimensions and proportions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Focusing on the buildings, the problem I want to solve is:
            <blockquote>
                Given a set of photographs of a
                building taken for various viewpoints, accurately derive the shape and dimensions of
                the building, and create a 3D model.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            I soon realized that the tools I needed didn't exist - so I set about creating them myself.
        </p>

        <h3>
            2.1 SketchUp Match Photo
        </h3>
        <p>
            Back in the early 2000s I used a 3D design software called
            <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/en">SketchUp</a>. It still exists today, and is a great
            application for 3D modeling. It has a unique feature called Match Photo, that allows the
            user to create 3D models by tracing lines over photographs. Here are some YouTube videos
            that demonstrate the process:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogGlGiu5VBM" target="_blank">

        </div>

        <p>
            I attempted to use SketchUp Match Photo myself, and found that it had several limitations:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For each photograph, the user must manually line up axis lines to determine the
                    orientation and field of view of the perspective camera. The camera view is very
                    sensitive to small changes in the positions of the axis lines, and it is difficult
                    to line everything up perfectly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As the user adds more photographs, it becomes increasingly difficult to line up new
                    photographs with the existing 3D model that was drawn from the first photograph. This
                    is because variations in building dimensions that are not noticeable from a particular
                    viewpoint in one photograph can be significant from a different viewpoint in another
                    photograph.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In order to get an accurate model, the user has to swap back and forth between multiple
                    photographs, making small adjustments to sizes and shapes of the 3D model and also
                    adjusting the camera perspectives to try to get everything to line up.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If you watch the videos, you can hear the presenters acknowledging some of these
            problems as they demonstrate the functionality. In the first video, the presenter
            actually gives up when he finds that the model doesn't match the second photo properly!
        </p>

        <h3>
            2.2 Photogrammetry, NeRFs, and Gaussian Splats
        </h3>
        <p>
            This <a href="https://www.spatial.capital/blog-posts/scene-representation" target="_blank">article</a> gives a
            good overview of these 3D reconstruction technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, they are not suitable for my use case for the following reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Many images are required to produce accurate 3D models. These techniques require
                    a minimum of hundreds of images taken from many different angles to achieve a
                    good level of accuracy. For my model railway buildings, I have between
                    one and twenty photographs to work with per building.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The generated models tend to have a wobbly appearance, rather than flat surfaces.
                    For my application - buildings with relatively simple geometric shapes - this is
                    not ideal. I would likely have to process the model after it is generated to
                    clean it up in order for it to be useful as a guide for a physical model.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>
            2.3 Photo Matching Using Optimization
        </h3>
        <p>
            Having considered the options, I felt I needed a technique that fell somewhere in the middle
            ground between the fully manual SketchUp approach, and the fully automated but data-hungry
            photogrammetry approach. I wanted an application that worked in a similar way to SketchUp,
            but automated the difficult and tedious positioning of the cameras and adjustment
            of the model dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I came up with the following idea: If I draw lines on photographs along the edges of walls,
            roofs, windows, doors, chimneys, can I use optimization to derive the position, orientation,
            and field of view of the camera? Furthermore, given several photos, can I derive the
            optimal dimensions of a building such that the dimensions cause each photo view to match up
            as closely as possible with the 3D model?
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer it turns out is yes, and this is how Photo Shapes works.
